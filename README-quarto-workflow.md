# Talks & Presentations - Quarto Workflow

This repo contains presentations I made in several places. 
These presentations are available through `https://cderv.github.io/presentations/<FOLDER_NAME>`

Some of the presentation are also hosted elsewhere but are linked here. Redirects from `https://cderv.github.io/presentations/<FOLDER_NAME>` to the actual hosting locations are provided for convenience.

## How to Update

This repository uses Quarto to generate:
1. The README.md file from README.qmd
2. Redirect HTML files from _presentations.yml

To update the list of presentations:

1. Edit the `_presentations.yml` file
2. Run `make` to regenerate everything
3. Commit the changes

## Currently Online

The list of presentations is generated from _presentations.yml.
